# Project Summary

In this project, we'll introduce you to React by creating a small project from scratch. We'll make use of the `create-react-app` CLI tool to quickly generate a React boilerplate. The goal of this project is to create a simple interface for creating a list of friends with their name and picture.

## Setup

* Fork and clone this repository.
* Run `sudo npm install -g create-react-app`.

## Step 1

### Summary

In this step, we'll use `create-react-app` to create a React boilerplate.

### Instructions

* `cd` into the root directory of the project.
* Run `create-react-app ./`.
* Delete the `README.md` the boilerplate generates and rename `README.old.md` back to `README.md`.

### Solution

## Step 2

### Summary

In this step, we'll clear the boilerplate that is made for us in `src/App.js`.

### Instructions

* Open `src/App.js`.
* Inside of the `return()` statement, replace everything with a single `<div>` element.

### Solution

import './App.css';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>

      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
